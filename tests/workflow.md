Solo Developer Workflow Summary

1. Project Setup

Set up project structure (src, tests, etc.)
Initialize Git repository
Create virtual environment
Set up basic files (README.md, .gitignore, requirements.txt)

2. Planning

Create GitHub Issues for features, bugs, and improvements
Organize issues into milestones
Set up a GitHub Project board (Kanban-style)

3. Development Cycle

Choose an issue to work on
Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-description
Work on the feature, committing frequently:
Copygit add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message"

Push changes regularly: git push origin feature/issue-description
Run tests locally

4. Self Code Review

Go to GitHub and create a new pull request
Review your own changes in the GitHub interface
Make any necessary adjustments locally and push again
Repeat until satisfied with the changes

5. Merging

Merge the pull request on GitHub
Pull the changes to your local main branch:
Copygit checkout main
git pull origin main

Delete the feature branch:
Copygit branch -d feature/issue-description
git push origin --delete feature/issue-description

6. Project Management

Move the completed issue to "Done" on your project board
Close the GitHub Issue

7. Release Process

Group completed features into a meaningful release
Update version number (follow Semantic Versioning)
Create a GitHub Release with release notes

Best Practices

Commit often with meaningful messages
Push changes daily or after significant progress
Always review your own code before merging
Keep the main branch stable and deployable
Update documentation alongside code changes
Run tests before every merge to main

Remember to adjust this workflow as needed to best suit your project and working style. The key is maintaining a balance between good practices and efficiency.
