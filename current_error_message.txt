Current Problem Analysis:

1. Data Flow Issue:
- The financial data is being fetched from the FMP API successfully
- The frontend is displaying this data directly from the API response
- However, the data is NOT being stored in our Supabase database tables as intended

2. Root Cause:
- The issue is in the server endpoint (src/routes/api/financial-data/[symbol]/+server.ts)
- While the code attempts to store data in Supabase, the upsert operations are failing silently
- The endpoint is returning the API data directly instead of waiting for database operations to complete
- There's no proper error handling for the database operations

3. Database Schema:
We have three main tables:
- income_statements
- balance_sheets
- cash_flow_statements

4. Required Fix:
a) Modify the server endpoint to:
   - Properly handle database operations
   - Wait for upsert operations to complete
   - Return data from database instead of API response
   - Add proper error handling for database operations
   - Log database operation results

b) Ensure data mapping matches table schema:
   - Verify all column names match exactly
   - Convert data types appropriately (especially for numeric values)
   - Handle null values properly

c) Verify Supabase permissions:
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly set up
   - Verify service role has proper permissions
   - Check if tables exist and have correct structure

5. Current Data Flow:
API -> Frontend (displaying data)
Should be:
API -> Database -> Frontend (displaying data from database)

6. Next Steps:
1. Add detailed logging for database operations
2. Verify table structures in Supabase
3. Test database operations independently
4. Fix data type conversions
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Return data from database instead of API response
