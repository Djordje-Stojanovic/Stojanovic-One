## Task: Add Valuation/DCF Calculator to Investment Analysis Platform

### Changes Made

1. **Created a new ValuationCalculatorModal component**
   - Created file: `src/lib/components/financials/valuation/ValuationCalculatorModal.svelte`
   - Implemented a popup modal that displays:
     - Historical financial data (last 5 years of revenue and earnings)
     - YoY% changes for revenue and net income
     - Input fields for future 5-year projections
     - Current and future P/E ratio inputs
     - Calculation of future market cap based on projections
     - Comparison with current market cap to show upside/downside percentage
     - Calculation of implied 5-year CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

2. **Added "Calculate Value" button to FinancialsHeader**
   - Modified: `src/lib/components/FinancialsHeader.svelte`
   - Added a new button next to the existing "Sync Data" and "Default View" buttons
   - Implemented handler to open the valuation calculator modal
   - Used consistent styling with other buttons in the header

3. **Implemented dynamic growth rate calculations**
   - Created functions to calculate YoY changes for historical data
   - Implemented future value projections based on growth rates
   - Added automatic initialization of growth rates based on historical averages
   - Implemented market cap, upside/downside, and CAGR calculations

4. **Enhanced input handling for better user experience**
   - Implemented separate tracking of raw input values during editing
   - Added handlers for input changes, blur events, and Enter key presses
   - Used bind:value for two-way binding with input fields
   - Added auto-selection of text when focusing on input fields
   - Fixed issue with immediate reformatting during typing by only updating on blur or Enter

5. **Added responsive styling**
   - Used consistent styling with the rest of the application
   - Implemented responsive grid layout for the valuation summary
   - Added color coding for positive/negative values
   - Used abbreviated number formatting for better readability
   - Fixed alignment issues between historical and projection tables
   - Added fixed width for metric column to ensure consistent layout

### Implementation Details

The valuation calculator follows these steps:
1. Extract the last 5 years of annual financial data from income statements
2. Calculate YoY changes for revenue and net income
3. Initialize future projections based on historical average growth rates
4. Allow user to modify future growth rates and P/E ratio
5. Calculate future values based on growth rates
6. Calculate future market cap as (Future Net Income Ã— Future P/E Ratio)
7. Calculate upside/downside percentage compared to current market cap
8. Calculate implied 5-year CAGR using the formula: CAGR = (1 + upside/downside)^(1/5) - 1

The input handling was carefully designed to provide a smooth user experience:
- Raw input values are tracked separately from the actual growth rates
- Values are only parsed and updated when the user is done typing (on blur or Enter)
- This prevents the issue where typing "12%" would immediately reformat after typing just "1"
- All input fields automatically select their content when focused for easy editing

### Files Modified

1. `src/lib/components/FinancialsHeader.svelte`
2. `src/lib/components/financials/valuation/ValuationCalculatorModal.svelte` (new file)

### Testing

The implementation can be tested by:
1. Visiting http://localhost:5173/subprojects/investment-analysis-platform/company/MNST/financials
2. Clicking the "Calculate Value" button
3. Viewing historical data and modifying future projections
4. Observing the dynamic updates to future values and upside/downside percentage
