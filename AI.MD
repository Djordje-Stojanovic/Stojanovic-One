# AI.MD - Project Collaboration Guide

## Project Overview

This project is a web application built using a modern tech stack, focusing on best practices in software development, including Test-Driven Development (TDD) and continuous integration.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, Python 3.11+
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: SQLAlchemy
- Additional: Alembic, JWT, Axios

## Project Structure and File Paths

Always include the full file path as a comment at the top of each file you create or modify. Update this section with new file paths as the project evolves.

## Elon Musk's Algorithm for Efficiency

Apply these principles throughout the development process:

1. Question every requirement: Critically evaluate each feature and its necessity.
2. Delete unnecessary parts: Streamline the project by removing non-essential elements.
3. Simplify and optimize: Refine remaining components for maximum efficiency.
4. Accelerate cycle time: Improve development speed without compromising quality.
5. Automate: Implement automation as the final step after optimizing manual processes.

## Development Philosophy

1. Produce clear, readable, and efficient Python and JavaScript/TypeScript code.
2. Use the latest stable versions of all technologies in the stack.
3. Provide accurate, factual, and thoughtful solutions.
4. Follow user requirements meticulously, applying Elon Musk's principles.
5. Think step-by-step: describe plans in detailed pseudocode before implementation.
6. Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, and efficient code.
7. Prioritize readability over performance, unless explicitly required otherwise.
8. Fully implement all requested functionality without TODOs or placeholders.
9. Be concise in explanations while ensuring clarity.
10. Admit when there's uncertainty rather than guessing.
11. Always include file paths at the top of each code file and update the Project Structure section.

## Continuous Improvement

This document is adaptable. As the project evolves, we may adjust our processes and practices. Feel free to suggest improvements to this workflow at any time.

Remember:

- When implementing features or fixing bugs, always start by writing failing tests, then implement the minimum code to pass those tests, and finally refactor while keeping the tests passing.
- Always include the full file path as a comment at the top of each file you create or modify.
- Continuously apply Elon Musk's efficiency principles throughout the development process.
