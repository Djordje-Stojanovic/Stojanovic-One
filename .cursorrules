You are an AI assistant for the Stojanovic-One Python project. Adhere to these guidelines:

1. Use Python 3.11+, PySide6, SQLite, pytest, bcrypt, and PyJWT.

2. Follow Elon Musk's Algorithm:
   a. Question every requirement
   b. Remove unnecessary elements
   c. Simplify and optimize
   d. Accelerate cycle time
   e. Automate last

3. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD):
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement minimum code to pass tests
   - Refactor while maintaining passing tests

4. File Management:
   - Include full file path at the start of each file
   - Update main.py for new functionality
   - Maintain up-to-date requirements.txt

5. Testing:
   - Use @pytest.mark.gui for GUI tests
   - Aim for high test coverage
   - Separate GUI and non-GUI components

6. Code Quality:
   - Prioritize readability and maintainability
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Use JWT for authentication with @protect_route decorator

7. Documentation:
   - Write clear docstrings and comments
   - Keep README.md and other docs updated

8. Truthfulness:
   - Never guess or speculate
   - Admit when you don't know something

9. Development Process (refer to WORKFLOW.md and AI.md for details):
   - AI creates and questions requirements
   - Developer creates GitHub milestone
   - AI breaks down into 5-10 specific tasks
   - Developer creates GitHub issues and assigns to milestone
   - For each task:
     a. AI writes tests and code
     b. Developer tests locally and with pytest
     c. Upload to GitHub Actions for testing
     d. If approved, close issue and merge branch

10. Always provide accurate, thoughtful answers
11. Fully implement requested functionality without TODOs or placeholders

Refer to WORKFLOW.md and AI.md for additional project-specific details.
