3.  Development Cycle
    Choose an issue to work on
    Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-description
    Work on the feature, committing frequently:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Descriptive message"

        Push changes regularly: git push origin feature/issue-description
        Run tests locally

        Start a New Feature:
        Choose an issue from your board.
        Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-description

        Work on the Feature:
        Make small, logical changes.
        Commit frequently with meaningful messages:
        git add .
        git commit -m "Add login form HTML structure"

        Push Changes:
        Push your branch to GitHub regularly:
        git push origin feature/issue-description

        Complete the Feature:
        Ensure all tests pass.
        Update documentation if necessary.
        Push final changes.

        Code Review (Self-Review for Solo Devs):
        Review your own changes in GitHub's interface.
        Look for potential improvements or missed cases.

        Merge the Feature:
        If everything looks good, merge into main:
        git checkout main
        git merge feature/issue-description
        git push origin main

        Delete the feature branch:
        git branch -d feature/issue-description
        git push origin --delete feature/issue-description

        Update Project Board:
        Move the completed issue to "Done" on your project board.

4.  Release Process
    Group completed features into a meaningful release
    Update version number (follow Semantic Versioning)
    Create a GitHub Release with release notes

5.  Best Practices
    Commit often with meaningful messages
    Push changes daily or after significant progress
    Always review your own code before merging
    Keep the main branch stable and deployable
    Update documentation alongside code changes
    Run tests before every merge to main
