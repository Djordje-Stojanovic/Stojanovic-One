        Expected behavior: DD-MM-YYYY

        Steps to reproduce:
        1. Log in to the application
        2. Navigate to user profile page
        3. Check the "Date of Birth" field

        Priority: Medium

        Improvement Issue
        Title: Enhance form validation feedback
        Description:
        Improve the user experience by providing more immediate and specific feedback for form validation errors.

        Tasks:
        - [ ] Add real-time validation for email format
        - [ ] Show password strength indicator
        - [ ] Display specific error messages for each field
        - [ ] Highlight fields with errors

        Acceptance Criteria:
        1. Email format is validated as the user types
        2. Password strength is indicated in real-time
        3. Each field displays a specific error message when invalid
        4. Fields with errors are visually highlighted
        _________________________________________________________________

3.  Refactoring
    Refactor the Issue into multiple smaller Issues then add together as a Milestone.

4.  Development Cycle
    Choose an issue to work on
    Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-description
    Work on the feature, committing frequently:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Descriptive message"

        Push changes regularly: git push origin feature/issue-description
        Run tests locally

        Start a New Feature:
        Choose an issue from your board.
        Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/issue-description

        Work on the Feature:
        Make small, logical changes.
        Commit frequently with meaningful messages:
        git add .
        git commit -m "Add login form HTML structure"

        Push Changes:
        Push your branch to GitHub regularly:
        git push origin feature/issue-description

        Complete the Feature:
        Ensure all tests pass.
        Update documentation if necessary.
        Push final changes.

        Code Review (Self-Review for Solo Devs):
        Review your own changes in GitHub's interface.
        Look for potential improvements or missed cases.

        Merge the Feature:
        If everything looks good, merge into main:
        git checkout main
        git merge feature/issue-description
        git push origin main

        Delete the feature branch:
        git branch -d feature/issue-description
        git push origin --delete feature/issue-description

        Update Project Board:
        Move the completed issue to "Done" on your project board.

5.  Release Process
    Group completed features into a meaningful release
    Update version number (follow Semantic Versioning)
    Create a GitHub Release with release notes

6.  Test Process
    For all tests locally:
    pytest -v --import-mode=importlib
    For non-Gui tests:
    pytest -v -m "not gui" --import-mode=importlib

7.  Testing
    Write unit tests for all new functionality
    Use pytest for running tests
    Implement GUI tests using pytest-qt
    Use pytest-mock for creating mock objects in tests
    Aim for high test coverage (e.g., 80% or higher)
    Run the full test suite before pushing changes

8.  Documentation
    Keep README.md up-to-date with project overview and setup instructions
    Use docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
    Update AI.MD with any changes to the development process or best practices
    Maintain a CHANGELOG.md to track significant changes between versions

9.  Continuous Integration
    Use GitHub Actions for automated testing
    Set up workflows to run tests on every push and pull request
    Include linting and type checking in the CI process

10. Dependency Management
    Regularly update dependencies in requirements.txt
    Use a tool like pip-compile to generate pinned requirements
    Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies regularly

11. Code Quality
    Use Black for code formatting
    Implement flake8 for linting
    Use mypy for static type checking
    Consider setting up pre-commit hooks for these tools

12. Performance Monitoring
    Regularly profile the application to identify bottlenecks
    Optimize database queries and UI rendering as needed
    Consider implementing logging for performance-critical operations

Remember to adapt this workflow as needed based on the project's specific requirements and your personal preferences.
